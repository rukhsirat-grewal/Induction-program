# 🏫 GNDEC Ludhiana: College Induction Program  (2025)

Welcome to my college journey! This repository documents my experience during the first few days at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana. These days marked the beginning of a new chapter—full of opportunities, spirituality, learning, and self-growth.

## 📅 Day 1: A New Beginning

After completing class 12th, stepping into college feels like entering a new world full of opportunities, challenges, and discoveries.

At GNDEC, I embarked on a journey of learning — a very important phase in life. A journey where I aspire to achieve success in academics and extracurriculars, with the support of my teachers.

### 🛐 Ceremony at College Gurdwara Sahib

The day began with the recitation of *Japji Sahib* at the college Gurdwara Sahib, followed by soul-touching **shabads**:

1. _"**ਹੇ ਗੋਬਿੰਦ ਹੇ ਗੋਪਾਲ ਹੇ ਦਇਆਲ ਲਾਲ ॥੧॥ ਰਹਾਉ ॥**"_
   > _"O Lord of the Universe, O Lord of the World, O Dear Merciful Beloved."_

2. _"**ਇਕ ਅਰਦਾਸਿ ਭਾਟ ਕੀਰਤਿ ਕੀ ਗੁਰ ਰਾਮਦਾਸ ਰਾਖਹੁ ਸਰਣਾਈ ॥੪॥੫੮॥**"_
   > _"Keerat the poet offers this one prayer: O Guru Raam Daas, save me! Take me into Your Sanctuary!"_

3. _"**ਸੁੰਦਰ ਸੋਭਾ ਲਾਲ ਗੋਪਾਲ ਦਇਆਲ ਕੀ ਅਪਰ ਅਪਾਰਾ ਰਾਮ ॥**"_
   > _"The Glory of the Beloved, Merciful Lord is beautiful; He is infinite and without limit."_

4. _"**ਤੁਮ ਮਾਤ ਪਿਤਾ ਹਮ ਬਾਰਿਕ ਤੇਰੇ ॥**"_
   > _"You are our mother and father; we are Your children."_

The calm atmosphere, positive energy, and divine blessings made for a beautiful start.
