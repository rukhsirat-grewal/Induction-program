# 🏫 GNDEC Ludhiana: College Induction Program  (2025)

Welcome to my college journey! This repository documents my experience during the first few days at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana. These days marked the beginning of a new chapter—full of opportunities, spirituality, learning, and self-growth.

## 📅 Day 1: A New Beginning

After completing class 12th, stepping into college feels like entering a new world full of opportunities, challenges, and discoveries.

At GNDEC, I embarked on a journey of learning — a very important phase in life. A journey where I aspire to achieve success in academics and extracurriculars, with the support of my teachers.

### 🛐 Ceremony at College Gurdwara Sahib

The day began with the recitation of *Japji Sahib* at the college Gurdwara Sahib, followed by soul-touching **shabads**:

1. _"**ਹੇ ਗੋਬਿੰਦ ਹੇ ਗੋਪਾਲ ਹੇ ਦਇਆਲ ਲਾਲ ॥੧॥ ਰਹਾਉ ॥**"_
   > _"O Lord of the Universe, O Lord of the World, O Dear Merciful Beloved."_

2. _"**ਇਕ ਅਰਦਾਸਿ ਭਾਟ ਕੀਰਤਿ ਕੀ ਗੁਰ ਰਾਮਦਾਸ ਰਾਖਹੁ ਸਰਣਾਈ ॥੪॥੫੮॥**"_
   > _"Keerat the poet offers this one prayer: O Guru Raam Daas, save me! Take me into Your Sanctuary!"_

3. _"**ਸੁੰਦਰ ਸੋਭਾ ਲਾਲ ਗੋਪਾਲ ਦਇਆਲ ਕੀ ਅਪਰ ਅਪਾਰਾ ਰਾਮ ॥**"_
   > _"The Glory of the Beloved, Merciful Lord is beautiful; He is infinite and without limit."_

4. _"**ਤੁਮ ਮਾਤ ਪਿਤਾ ਹਮ ਬਾਰਿਕ ਤੇਰੇ ॥**"_
   > _"You are our mother and father; we are Your children."_

The calm atmosphere, positive energy, and divine blessings made for a beautiful start.

# Day 5 - August 6, 2025

The day began with HOD mam Mrs. Harpreet Kaur Grewal leading the chanting of the *Mool Mantra*, followed by Dr. Parminder Singh, Dean of Student Welfare. He introduced us to all the societies, clubs, and amenities offered by the college. This session was highly informative and helped us become more familiar with the college.

Next, Mr. Manpreet Singh delivered a powerful lecture on **“Fitness for Engineers.”** He spoke about the dangers of unhealthy diets and drug addiction, emphasizing the importance of regular exercise and a good diet. He urged all students to avoid alcohol and other substances that can harm the body and family.

Students asked several questions about **whey protein**, **steroids**, and **weight loss tips**, to which he gave clear and powerful insights. He also shared his personal story of transformation, motivating us to prioritize fitness and discipline in our lives as engineers.

After this, the **NCC students** showcased the achievements and dedication of NCC cadets. This was followed by a warm welcome to **Brigadier P. S. Cheema**, who used poetic lines on patriotism and humility to inspire us. He encouraged us to join NCC and voiced concerns about the youth's direction today.

We then had our **Physics lecture** by Prof. Jaspreet Singh, who introduced the syllabus and provided tips on scoring well.

The day concluded with a **P2P (Peer-to-Peer)** class with seniors, where we gained valuable knowledge about the **C++ programming language**.

> **My favorite part of the day:**  
> The lecture by Mr. Manpreet Singh — it was truly inspiring and motivated us to follow our hearts and work hard toward our goals.
>
> # Day 6 - August 7, 2025

Our day started at 9:30 AM with a **Physics lecture** by Mr. Jaspreet Singh. He gave a basic introduction to the chapter on **Lasers**, asked us questions, and guided us through a few problems. He explained everything clearly and was a great teacher.

Next was a **Maths lecture** by Prof. Sandeep Kaur Gill, where we revised **differentiation** and **basic calculus**. She asked conceptual questions and interacted with every student. I was happy to answer 3–4 questions correctly.

After an hour-long break, we went to the auditorium for a session with **Dr. Lakhvir Singh Khana**, In-charge of the **Centre for Multifaceted Learning (CML)**. He praised our enthusiasm and introduced the various activities organized by CML. He also spoke about **NPTEL** and **SWAYAM**, platforms offering online courses in collaboration with the IITs. He gave a demo on how to create a profile and enroll in courses.

Later, **Dr. Jasvir Singh Grewal**, in charge of **NSS**, recited the *Shabad* by Guru Arjan Dev Ji in Raag Kalyan:

> **"ਮੇਰੇ ਲਾਲਨ ਕੀ ਸੋਭਾ ॥"**  
> *"O, the Wondrous Glory of my Beloved!"*

It was beautifully sung by students and filled the hall with peace and positivity. Sir spoke about the joy and peace in helping others — the core value of **NSS**.

A **Sanskrit raag** followed, starting with:  
> *“रैना बीती जाये, श्याम ना आये |”*

After this, we watched a **Midway Island** documentary that showed how plastic pollution is affecting bird life. It deeply moved us and reinforced the environmental goals of NSS.

Finally, a fun game was played where two students had to make each other laugh in 60 seconds — none succeeded, but it brought a lot of laughter to the auditorium. Two NSS members also performed a hilarious act that entertained everyone.

> **Takeaway from the day:**  
> The last session was truly eye-opening, reminding us of the urgent need to protect our environment and rethink how our actions affect wildlife and health.
